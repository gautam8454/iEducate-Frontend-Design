            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future
                society at large or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized
                by some governments and the United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable
                Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory
                up to a certain age.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]

                In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[5]

                The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl
                called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of
                strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed
                that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians
                cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.[8] There
                was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."[7] These concepts
                underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next
                generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual
                development and his integration into the community.[7]

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary
                education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a
                high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and
                postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly
                provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions.
                Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic
                degrees.

                The ISCED distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7
                is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8 is an advanced research
                qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of
                publishable quality based on original research.[23] The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle
                courses of requiring degree level study.[23]

                Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. In
                most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at
                some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a
                significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of
                the economy.
